		<p class="hideme">Hey there! My name is Jacob Crumb, author of the Crumby Engineer web page you see right now. Since you cliked the "about" link on the top of the page, I am assuming you would like to get to know the creator of the page(if not, then I am a bit confused as to what you thought "about" was going to mean).</p>

		<p class="hideme"> I was raised in an Army family, homeschooled, and have traveled a good deal of the east coast before I was 10. It was awesome. My childhood consisted of me doing everything from being out doors, going to the beach, hiking woodlands, and all sorts of other cool things.<p>

		<p> As I grew up, I thought about doing everything from going into the ministry to becoming a wildlife biologist or a teacher. I decided on none of those, and decided to self train as a javascript developer. It has been a fun, and occasionaly frustrating journey, but one I have been enjoying so far. My hope is to help make websites and other projects and have fun along the way.</p>

		<p> When I am not working or learning the principals and practices of web development, I enjoy taking walks with my longsuffering and beautiful wife, watching NCIS on netflix, and still taking the occasional hike whenever time or weather permits me.</p>
